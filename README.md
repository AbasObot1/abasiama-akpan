# abasiama-akpan
Abasiama Akpan (Abas Obot) personal portfolio website project. 
I am building a personal website from scratch through direct coding with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and use of Bootstrap.
User interface and experience play vital roles when it comes to meeting one's online objective. Thank God for the modernized way of development. The objective of this project is not just about building a website from scratch, but maximizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Coding frameworks like Bootstrap to create a website that wows the mind.
